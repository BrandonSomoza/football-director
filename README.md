# Football Club Director

Football Club Director is a football management simulation game inspired by games like Basketball GM and Football SD. Take on the role of a football club director, managing every aspect of your team to lead them to glory!

## Features (Planned)

- **Team Management**: Assemble your squad, manage contracts, and scout new talent.
- **Match Simulation**: Watch matches unfold or simulate results instantly.
- **Financial Control**: Balance your budget, negotiate sponsorships, and manage stadium expansions.
- **Tactical Strategy**: Design formations and set in-depth tactical instructions.
  - I don't want this to be super in depth --> I'll allocate space for 1 goalie, 4 defenders, 3 midfielders, and 3 forwards for every team. Maybe down the road I will add tactics/formations

## Technology Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for the game logic.
- **IndexedDB**: For efficient local storage of game data on the user's device, enabling offline play.
